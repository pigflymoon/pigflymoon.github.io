                            5. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.
                        </p>

                            online or offline. You agree that Cardmaker App is not responsible or liable for the conduct of

                            interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other
                            information.
                        </p>

                            features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party
                            content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also
                            permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including
                            applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web
                            site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share
                            Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on
                            that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you
                            to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk.
                            Cardmaker App does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content.
                            You expressly acknowledge and agree that Cardmaker App is in no way responsible or liable for
                            any such third-party services or features.
                            YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE
                            SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY.
                            You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that
                            connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service each, an
                            "Application" and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull
                            information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge
                            and agree to the following: if you use an Application to share information, you are
                            consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; your use of an

                            7. Although it is Cardmaker App's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible,

                            for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of
                            telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Cardmaker App reserves the right to remove any
                            Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the

                            order. Consequently, Cardmaker App encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content.
                            In other words, Cardmaker App is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on
                            the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Cardmaker App will not be liable to

                            of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Cardmaker App,
                            and Cardmaker App will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
